# Traffic-Light-Control-System-using-DP
The aim of this project is to develop an optimized traffic light control system using dynamic programming techniques. The primary objective is to reduce traffic congestion and improve traffic flow efficiency at intersections. The project leverages dynamic programming to determine optimal light phase sequences that minimize the average waiting time for vehicles and maximize throughput. By modelling traffic patterns and considering various parameters such as vehicle arrival rates, queue lengths, and intersection layouts, the system dynamically adjusts the traffic light phases in real-time. This approach promises significant improvements over traditional fixed-timing or actuated control systems, leading to smoother traffic flow and reduced emissions.
